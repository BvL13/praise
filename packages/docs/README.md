# Praise

## Background

The praise process has served us (and the TEC and Giveth) well over a number of months. Now, we would like to take the insights accumulated and upgrade Praise to a standalone open source system that can be easily implemented by any community.

## Vision

With praise, we want to invite communities to build a culture of giving and gratitude, involving contributors at every step of the process.

Praise allows communities to capture the full spectrum of value created - ranging from small to large contributions over a number of platforms. Even contributions made outside of any tech platform can be praised.

Praise believes that transparency and community involvement are key to successful contribution tracking and rewarding. All steps of the praise process are subject to community influence using the governance tool of choice.

By adjusting praise value parameters, the community behaviour can be modelled and changed over time. Use the included analytics tools to compare end results with intended outcomes.

Our ambition is to release a first version of Praise before the end of the year.

## New features

- Standalone system with a web2 backend / database.
- Ethereum / Metamask used for authentication
- Easy to install package!
    - Ready to install Docker image.
    - Documentation!
- The concept of quantifiers – individuals chosen to quantify the weight of each praise.
- Praise data is split and randomly assigned to quantifiers.
- Decreased quantifier workload:
    - Automate what can be automated
    - Make the quantification process asynchronous
- Calculate token distributions based on praise score:
    - Make that calculation configurable
- A transparent process:
    - All history is saved, no overwriting of data.
    - Community votes can be attached and referenced where applicable
    - Always up to date analytics!

## Roadmap / timeframe

It is important to have an MVP online as close to the TEC Commons Upgrade as possible, a prolonged period after the CU with no working praise system in place would be bad.

- MVP – Done by end of Nov
    - The short term goal is developing the functionality TEC needs in order to run their day to day. Focus will be placed on core functions – async quantification, compiling of data and calculation of token rewards. As simple as possible. No data exports, no analytics, no metmask login etc.
- v1.0 beta – Done by end of Jan
    - This secondary goal means implementing the rest of the planned functionality including quantification dashboards, analytics etc..
